To execute this command, you will only need to open a scene that contains some type of texture,
copy the contents of the main.py file, and paste the Maya Script Editor, in a python tab.

I dont include a scene with textures since it would be useful to anyone and an my scene could
give problems with textures directories, but you can use any one
